# RMIT Lectopia Reader

Part 1 of a project based off of the apparently defunct Lectopia Hub.

This is a basic web crawler that scrapes data from RMIT's Lectopia pages. There's an option to export said data to a .json file which can be used by something in Part 2 if I ever get around to making that.

There's a console UI for searching and stuff. It's mostly there just for testing purposes though.

## Libraries used

- HtmlAgilityPack
- Json.NET
